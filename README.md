# AUTOMATA-Humanoid-robotics-system-design

## Project Overview

`AUTOMATA-Humanoid-robotics-system-design` is a research- and application-oriented humanoid robotics system project. It aims to develop advanced perception, locomotion, and planning capabilities, with a special focus on the RoboCup humanoid footall scenario. The project integrates multiple core modules and provides a unified framework for complex real-world tasks.
